*Test task for Digidentity, done by N. Rys*

Since the task is open-ended, I needed to make a call when to stop. Here are some things that I've cut out:
* Tests for controllers
* Proper stylesheets
* Authentication that is not based on a session and can be hijacked


## Usage
* Balance is stored in cents, both in transactions and user accounts.
* In preloaded data the passwords for all users match the part before @ sign, for example: `username@example.com` has password `username`

### Add user

### Add balance

### Remove balance
